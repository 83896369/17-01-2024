            deadline specified in HIPAA. Therefore, in October 1999, President Clinton and
            Secretary Donna Shalala unveiled their medical privacy proposal.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The final ruling for the HIPAA was in April 2001 under President George Bush. Most
            covered entities have two years (until April 2003) to comply with the final revisions of
            this law. This final law requires that all health organizations— including health care
            providers, insurers, and transaction processors— come into compliance with HIPAA by
            the April 2003 date. . However, it does not cover health-oriented websites that may collect
            personal data.

            Under this law, patients have the right to control how their personal health
            information is used and must be able to get access to their own medical records if desired.
            Of course, patients must sign a release before records can be given to any party.
            However, patients do have the right to limit or withdraw this release of information.
            Health care organizations are required to have written privacy procedures detailing how
            information is used and disclosed and are required to provide this information to patients
            upon request.

        <h2>The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999</h2>
        <p>
            The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act became federal law in November 1999, and states were
            ordered to comply (although the law did not preempt states from adopting more strict
            privacy standards). In general, this law states that financial institutions can only share
            information with affiliates and nonaffiliated companies after giving customers the option
            to “opt-out” of certain disclosures. Personal information can only be shared only after
            a consumer has had an opportunity to opt-out. Therefore, organizations must notify
            individuals when they are planning to share private information outside the scope of
            typical financial transactions; e.g., selling it to others who plan on using it for data-mining
            purposes. Enforcement began July 1, 2001. When financial institutions sent out federally
            mandated privacy notices in the summer of 2001, only 2% to 3% of all consumers opted
            out (Thibodeau, 2002). 
        </p>
        <p>
            The privacy provisions of Title V of the Act apply only to non-public personal
            information about individuals who obtain financial products or services for personal,
            family, or household purposes, and not to companies or individuals obtaining products
            or services for business purposes (Hirsch, 2000). In addition, this law requires that both
            stored and transmitted information be encrypted if security cannot be guaranteed. The
            following federal agencies have responsibility for enforcing the Act: the Federal Trade
            Commission (FTC), the Department of the Treasury, the Comptroller of the Currency, the
            Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit
            Union Administration, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Because the
            Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Act opened the door for banking and insurance
            markets to enter one another’s business, both industries were compelled to gain more
            information about their customers to cross-sell banking, investment and insurance
            services” (Ruquet, 2000). 
        </p>
        <p>
            The state of Vermont has taken a much stronger position than the Federal statute
            by requiring (as of February 15, 2002) financial institutions to acquire affirmative
            customer consent (opt-in) of its citizens before personal data about customers from
            Vermont can be shared with others. Insurance trade groups retaliated by filing suit on             
        </p>

        <p>
            January 30, 2002, and threatening price increases (Thibodeau, 2002). In response to
            industry complaints, Elizabeth Costle, Commissioner of the Vermont Department of
            Banking, Insurance, Securities, and Health Care Administration, stated, “The industry
            can just assume that everyone with a Vermont ZIP code has opted out. That’s the easy
            way to fix your computers” (Thibodeau, 2002, p. 16). Vermont’s rules are a broader
            application of the state’s existing banking privacy laws and not a result of legislature
            action (Thibodeau, 2002, p. 16). The insurance industry argues in its suit that the banking
            commission usurped legislative authority. Opt-in requires companies to convince
            consumers of the benefits of sharing their personal information with others. Vermont is
            not alone concerning “opt-in.” According to the Internet Alliance, 13 states have
            pending opt-in privacy bills: Arkansas, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Mas-sachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Jersey and New
            York (Thibodeau, 2002). New Mexico is considering regulatory action similar to
            Vermont’s. When acquiring data to mine, differences in state laws and regulations like
            Vermont’s opt-in policy will play a role in acquiring data that can be legally used.

        <h2>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</h2>
        <p>
            To protect children’s privacy online, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
            (COPPA) was created, with final legislation going into effect on April 21, 2000. It regulates
            the collection of personal information from individuals under the age of 13. The Federal
            Trade Commission (FTC) has been charged with issuing and enforcing rules concerning
            COPPA. COPPA was the first act involving government regulation solely for the Internet.
            Because of this law, websites must get parental permission before collecting or using
            personal information from children. Websites must have a privacy policy that explains
            what information is collected, how it is collected, and how it will be used. This privacy
            policy must be in plain view on the website. If a company makes a material change in its
            privacy policy, it must obtain consent from all parents again. COPPA applies to
            commercial websites and online services that target and collect information from
            children. The Act also applies to operators of general sites who have actual knowledge
            that they are collecting information from children under 13 years of age. Under the
            COPPA guidelines, operators of such sites must adhere to the following guidelines (FTC
            Website, <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.htm">http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.htm</a>):       
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>post clear and comprehensive Privacy Policies on the website describing their
                information practices for children’s personal information;</li>
            <li>provide notice to parents, and with limited exceptions, obtain verifiable parental
                consent before collecting personal information from children;</li>
            <li> give parents the choice to consent to the operator’s collection and use of a child’s
                information while prohibiting the operator from disclosing that information to third
                parties;</li>
            <li>
                provide parents with access to their child’s personal information to review and/or
                have it deleted;
            </li>
            <li>
                give parents the opportunity to prevent further collection or use of the information;
                and
            </li>
            <li>maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of information they collect from
                children.
            </li>    
        </ol>
        <p>
            In addition, operators are prohibited from conditioning a child’s participation in an
            online activity on the child providing more information than is reasonably necessary to
            participate in that activity. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After a three-year effort by the FTC to identify and educate the industry and the
            public about privacy issues, the FTC recommended that Congress enact legislation
            protecting children. A March 1998 survey of 212 commercial children’s websites found
            that “while 89% of the sites collected personal information from children, only 24%
            posted privacy policies, and only 1% required parental consent to the collection or
            disclosure of children’s information” (FTC, 1999).
        </p>
        <p>
            Ignorance of the law is not a defense in a court of law. If you are caught violating
            COPPA, you can be fined up to $11,000 per child per incident. Non-profit organizations,
            however, are exempt from COPPA. For more information about COPPA, you can visit the
            following sites: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy, http://www.kidsprivacy.org, and http:/

        <h2>USA Patriot Act of 2001</h2>
        <p>
            The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required
            to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot) Act of 2001 is not a single new law but
            rather an omnibus piece of legislation that amends dozens of existing laws (Fausett, 2001,
            p. 10). Hence, if you read the text of the Act without a copy of the United States Code
            close at hand, it will make no sense whatsoever. According to M. Scott (2001), the act: 
        </p>
        <center>
            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
                “greatly expands the right of law enforcement officials to wiretap the Web,
                including information transmitted over the Internet, corporate in-house net-works and voice mail systems. It also lets them search stored e-mails and voice
                mails to collect evidence that may be useful in prosecuting criminals, includ-ing terrorists.” (p. 82)
            </p>
        </center>
        <p>
            Unlike the Electronic Communications Privacy Act that requires a subpoena or
            search warrant, Section 212 of the Patriot Act “lets a system operator voluntarily disclose
            customer information along with the content of stored e-mail messages to a governmental
            entity if the provider reasonably believes that an emergency involving immediate danger
            of death, or serious physical injury to any person justifies disclosure.” (M. Scott, 2001,
            p. 82). Section 210 of the Act requires an e-mail system operator to disclose the means
            or source of payment for the provider’s services, records of session times and durations,
            and any temporarily assigned network addresses. The hope is that such information may
            help locate terrorists and those who fund them. This Act can provide a wealth of
            information on suspected criminals and terrorists that law enforcement agencies can
            merge with other data overlays to data mine in order to better identify candidates for
            intense scrutiny.

        <h2>International Laws</h2>
        <p>
            Many nations have data protection laws that attempt to ensure an individual’s
            privacy rights. These include but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Russian Federation Law on Information, Informatization, and Information

        <p>
            The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Privacy International re-viewed the state of privacy in over fifty countries around the world (“Privacy & Human
            Rights, 2000,” 2000). The report found many countries around the world are enacting
            comprehensive data protection laws. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Other nations, such as China and India, have no general data protection laws
            enacted, although data privacy is referred to in a few regulations in both countries.
            Interestingly, however, the Chinese Constitution proclaims citizens have limited rights
            to privacy even though few laws limit government actions. For example, Article 37 of its
            constitution provides that the freedom of citizens of the People’s Republic of China is
            inviolable, and Article 40 states: “Freedom and privacy of correspondence of citizens of
            the People’s Republic of China are protected by law.” However, whenever technological
            advancements seem on the brink of loosening the government’s grip over its citizens,
            the Chinese government uses all its power to either suppress the technology or mold it
            to fit its own political agenda. For readers who are interested in exploring international
            laws pertaining to privacy and data protection, see <a href="http://www.privacyinternational.org/

        <h2>Laws and Data Mining</h2>
        <p>
            The majority of laws that safeguard the privacy of consumers are positive for
            society because they make people feel comfortable providing information as well as
            purchasing or renting material, and this helps the economy. However, the downside of
            any database is that it is never totally secure from “the outside.” Many of these laws
            pertain to the collection and dissemination of data. Companies interested in data mining
            must respect these restrictions. Despite these legal developments, there are still
            questions that remain open for debate. Table 4 lists some of the more pertinent questions.
        </p>
        <center>
            <h2>FUTURE TRENDS</h2>
        </center>
        <p>
            As our world becomes more interconnected, it will be possible to create detailed
            profiles on practically anyone. “According to one estimate, there are now 2.5 million
            surveillance cameras in Britain, and the average Briton is now thought to be photo-graphed by 300 separate cameras in a single day” (Rosen, 2001, p. 24). The line between
            private and public information continues to shift with time (Figure 2). What was once
            considered private is now more likely contained in the public domain. The shift can
            greatly be attributed to the increased use of databases and the more recent use of the
            Internet as a way to collect and manipulate information (Caudill & Murphy, 2000). In a
            recent article, legal scholar Jeffrey Rosen (2001) stated that:
        </p>
        <center>
            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
                “At the beginning of the 21st century, however, thanks to the Internet, and the
                September 11 attack on the World Trade Center – which gave rise to the new
                antiterrorism law that gives authorities far more latitude to inspect logs of
                Internet use – we have vastly expanded the aspect of private life that can be
                monitored and recorded. As a result, there is increased danger that personal
                information originally disclosed to friends and colleagues may be exposed to,
                and misinterpreted by, a less-understanding audience.” (p. 19)
            </p>
        </center>
        <p>
            As shown in Figure 2, the events of September 11, 2001 (which prompted new
            legislation and concern) have greatly excelled the rate at which information is changing
            from the private domain to the public domain. Looking back at Table 3, we may see more
            future legislation that will in fact invade privacy rather than protect it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Relating back to Figure 1, at some point, enough individuals will be negatively
            impacted so that society will react by implementing legal countermeasures that prohibit
            and restrict all aspects of the data industry. It is in businesses’ best interest to behave
            in the most ethical manner possible, so as not to create an environment in which
            lawmakers feel compelled to act. What does the future hold for data mining? After the
            events of September 11, 2001, society will more than likely demand that government
            institute anti-terrorist measures in which data mining will play a fundamental role.
            However, “Britain’s experience in the fight against terrorism suggests that people may
            give up liberties without experiencing a corresponding increase in security” (Rosen,
            2001, p. 24). Businesses will continue to encroach on personal privacy. Therefore, it is
            up to individuals to guard their personal data.
